Insight Data Science Project
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Classical music artists post videos to Youtube in hopes of getting appreciation, encouragement, and feedback, and potentially raising their artist profile or monetizing their channel. However, there are many thousands of videos on Youtube for any piece in the classical music repertoire and it is difficult to get the attention of potential viewers.

SOLUTION
Classical Audio Doctor helps music video creators by evaluating the text and audio features of a submitted Youtube video and suggesting changes to the post to increase predicted views. Classical Audio Doctor does this based on an XGBoost classifier model trained on violin performances that predicts low, medium, or high views, and local interpretation of the contribution of the text or audio features to the probability of classifying into the next higher view category to make and rank suggestions for improvement.

This project was completed from ideation to launch on AWS in four weeks as part of the Insight Data Science Fellowship program.
